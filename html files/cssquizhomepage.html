				<h2 style="color:black"><u>OVERVIEW:</u></h2>
				Visual Studio gives you the following tools to create, apply, and manage styles and cascading style sheets (CSS):
The Apply Styles window lets you create, modify, and apply styles. You can also link to or remove an external CSS. The window identifies style types, and shows you whether the style is used in the current webpage and whether the current selection uses it.
The Manage Styles window provides many of the same features as the Apply Styles window. However, you can use the Manage Styles window to move styles from a  section in a page to an external style sheet or vice versa. You can also use it to move styles inside a style sheet.
The CSS Properties window shows you the styles that are used by the current selection in a webpage. It also shows you the order of precedence for the styles. In addition, the window gives you a comprehensive list of all CSS properties. You can add properties to an existing style, modify properties that you have already set, and create new inline styles. For more information, see How to: Use the CSS Properties Window. 
If you are working with ASP.NET Web Forms pages (.aspx files), the tag selector lets you select HTML tags while you are working in a webpage. The tag selector bar is at the bottom of the editing window. When you put the cursor anywhere in a page, the quick tag selector bar displays tags that show the underlying HTML tag for that area. You can also use the ESC key to move up 
the HTML hierarchy to select tags that are nested inside other tags.<br>

				Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[2]
CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of presentation and content, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
Separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice 
(via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. It can also display the web page differently depending on the screen size or viewing device. Readers can also specify a different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author specified.
Changes to the graphic design of a document (or hundreds of documents) can be applied quickly and easily, by editing a few lines in the CSS file they use, rather than by changing markup in the documents.
The CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities (or weights) are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.
The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents<br>
				<h2><u>DEVELOPMENT :</u></h2>Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.
For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for these elements is presentational.
Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers.
 The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup
